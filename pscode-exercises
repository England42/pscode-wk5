// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

read input into num1
read input into num2

sum = num1 + num2

write "The sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

read input into num

if num modulo 2 is equal to 0 then
    write num + " is an even number"
else
    write num + " is an odd number"

// Exercise 3: 
// Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

// a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
// b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
// c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
// d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

numbers = []
for i = 1 to 5
    read input into num
    append num to numbers

total = 0
for each num in numbers
    total = total + num
average = total / 5

smallest = numbers[0]
largest = numbers[0]
for each num in numbers
    if num < smallest
        smallest = num
    if num > largest
        largest = num

write "The average of the five numbers is: " + average
write "The smallest number is: " + smallest
write "The largest number is: " + largest
